# Speech_Recording_Tool

Speech Recording Rool is a small web application to collect short snippets of speech. It's designed to help gather open speech data sets to train machine learning systems.

It's based around a small Flask app. This serves up a client-side angular app that prompts a series of sentences, records the audio, and then POSTs the results back to the server.
